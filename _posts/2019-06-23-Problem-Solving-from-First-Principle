description: How the First principle helps us to solve the some of the complex problems in the world!!

On one side tech entrepreneur like Jack Ma advocating for 9-9-6 work culture & other side people fight for 40 hours equality!
But, there are some global leaders like Narendra Modi, Warren Buffett, Marissa Mayer, Elon Musk who work more than 100+ hours to accomplish their goals.

In this diverse argument, At the age of 46, Elon Musk has innovated and built four revolutionary multibillion-dollar companies in completely different fields — Paypal (Financial Services), Tesla Motors (Automotive) and SpaceX (Aerospace), Boring (Transportation).

How these people achieve so much within a short span of time??

How did he able to manage all these things ??

What is the secret behind there success??
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The answer is simple:
<br/>
<b>Read, Read & More Read!!!<b/>

No doubt Reading plays an important role in unlocking your inner creative genius and becoming the best at what you do — but there’s more to this —

Reading new things continuously over a period of time. (power of compounding) will change the way you think!!

Learning is the single best investment of our time that we can make. Or as Benjamin Franklin said, “An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”

Thinking from the First Principle gives many Out of box & innovative solutions to hard problems.
Your brain encourages you to think in analogies, as this is the most efficient and safest way of thinking. So how do you break this programming, take a step back and start thinking in basic principles?

First Principle: The Building Blocks of True Knowledge!!
<br/>
<p><i>First-principles thinking is one of the best ways to reverse-engineer complicated problems. the idea is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up. 
It’s one of the best ways to learn to think for yourself, unlock your creative potential, and move from linear to non-linear results.
</i></p>

<p>When Elon Musk’s started development of the TESLA electric car, many experts felt that electric vehicles could not be popular because of battery costs. 
The $600/kW is the market price, The battery has always been so expensive. Which increased in 2/3rd of production cost.
</p>
<p>Why it's $600/kW ??</p>
<br/>
<p>“That’s just the way they will always be because that’s the way they have been in the past”.
</p>
<p>
However, Elon Musk does not agree!! He needs to understand the root cause of the Problem, He applied First-principles methodology!!
</p>

What are the material constituents of the batteries?
<br/>
What is the spot market value of the material constituents?
<br/>
When he dig dipper into the ground, basic things like cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, and some polymers for separation, and steel can enough to produce a battery pack;
<br/>
<p>
Next, If we bought that on a London Metal Exchange, what would each of these things cost?
 Oh, god, it’s … $80 per kilowatt-hour. 
 So, clearly, you just need to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of a battery cell, and you can have batteries that are much, much cheaper than anyone realizes.
