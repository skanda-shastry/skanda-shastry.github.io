  &lt;p&gt;Our nuclear bases still use CD/floppy disk. 
Our new fighter can‚Äôt even fly in the rain.
Instead of going to mars, we have invaded the Middle East.
We wanted flying cars, we got 140 characters.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Energy consumption &amp;amp; speed of vehicle still stagnant. Automobiles still travel 80‚Äì100mph on our highways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Boeing 747 first flew in 1969, yet it still is the main jet carrying people across Pacific oceans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Until Motorola &amp;amp; Nokia come up with mobile phone AT &amp;amp; T never do any innovation in its telephone &amp;amp; telegraph design. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Data is the new Oil&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Above examples reflect, where we moving in the field of innovation &amp;amp; research. All the innovation in 20th mostly on Atoms &amp;amp; 21st century with Bits. Most of the companies in the world majorly categorized either bits or atoms companies &amp;amp; its part of one of the below 5 business models.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bits:&lt;/b&gt; Company which builds on bits &amp;amp; bytes (0s &amp;amp; 1s) as a fundamental building block. most of the Internet/Software company survive with this principle. Innovation in this area is consistently accelerating in this area. there are too many bits companies right now (WhatsApp, Google, Facebook, Twitter) 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;Atoms:&lt;/b&gt; The smallest unit of matter. &amp;amp; The company which builds purely based on substances aka company having physical visible products. Innovation in this area is consistently slow down in this area. (Ford, Coca-Cola, YKK, Luxottica, GE)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Combined Bit &amp;amp; Atom : &lt;/b&gt;
However, the above two sectors are not mutually exclusive. There is a 3rd group where the most successful companies are coming up with products and services that really do combine the best of both worlds i.e. bits and atoms.
The most interesting start-ups seem to sit at the intersection of the two‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey use bits to manipulate atoms. (Apple, Amazon, Uber) control over both bit (software) &amp;amp; atom (Hardware) market.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Converting Atoms to Bits : &lt;/b&gt; 
The new internet age was all about the overwhelming superiority of customer experience &amp;amp; transforming the atoms to bits across the information superhighway.
* Conversion of the Books to kindle, &lt;br /&gt;
 * Plastic CD/DVD, walkmans to iTunes, &lt;br /&gt;
 * Money to PayPal/VISA,  &lt;br /&gt;
 * Blockbuster to Netflix, &lt;br /&gt;
 * Camera roll to Digital Image, &lt;br /&gt;
 * Print media (Newspaper) to FB/Twitter, &lt;br /&gt;
 * College classes to Online classes (Udacity/Coursera)
 &amp;amp; many more atom contents converts into bit version, &amp;amp; become fabulously wealthy. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; Converting bits to atom: &lt;/b&gt;
 There are hardly very few companies which transform the bits into atoms(Microprocessor, Biotech, Robotics, 3DPriniting ) In this model involves the highest Regulatory norms &amp;amp; Cost of conversion is high. &lt;/p&gt;

The slogan ‚Äòinnovate or perish‚Äô stands true to its words. As brands can only survive in the market if they are constantly innovating and offering something new on the platter with time. Ultimately, It‚Äôs the innovation that helps businesses differentiate their products and services from competition, deliver greater value to customers, and build brands. In order to survive in this battle, Design thinking is one of the best solutions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kept ‚Äúthinking outside the box‚Äù on this core principle new way to solve the wicked problems &amp;amp; Its a powerful tool to tackle the unknown.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Design vs Expeirence&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs Changed? &lt;br /&gt;
The Internet has changed absolutely everything,like other disruption affect the print media very badly from this way of consuming the news &amp;amp; Consumer behaviour around the world is changing dramatically.
&lt;br /&gt;
What is a better product design? &lt;br /&gt;
From above 3 set of Images, Starting from the conventional way of getting the news with comprehensive details,full of scrolling grids, videos and text (CNN BBC NBC, TOI) which include both relevant &amp;amp; irrelevant news.
Moved to the customised, hand curated, short, crisp and relevant news within 60 words.(In short, Flipboard)
Finally, we are in the age where, news feed based on your behavioural data &amp;amp; digital demography via AI, deep learning &amp;amp; chat bot (Quartz,Toutiao)
From the above example, there is a paradigm shift in the news consumption &amp;amp; also in the Product Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Here are the few example about Human center design !!!&lt;/p&gt;
